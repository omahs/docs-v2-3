# Our DNA

### Our DNA Statement:

> #### _Pocket’s purpose is to power unstoppable open data and open infrastructure, governed by its users_&#x20;

POKT Network are the RPC base layer, or universal RPC infrastructure.

As of today, we incentivize and coordinate a decentralized network of operators to run a type of blockchain node (an RPC node) that enables applications to read / write to blockchains.

With one connection developers can access data from 50+ chains with low cost and high resilience.

We've been building since 2017 and operating on mainnet since 2020. Since then we've served almost 700 billion relays, through thousands of nodes across 22 countries.

In the future, POKT Network's protocol could serve any open-data source.

### Our Purpose is to:

> #### _Provide the world with unstoppable open data_

We believe that the economies of the future will run on blockchain technology and we want the infrastructure that powers that to be owned by users, not corporations.

### Our Mission is to:

> #### _Empower developers with access to the most reliable, performant and cost-effective data_

To access POKT Network decentralized infra, you need to go through a 'Gateway'.&#x20;

This reduces friction when interacting with the protocol and also enables businesses to build on top of our robust RPC base layer, while optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) and innovating to bring new features and services to you and to our ecosystem. &#x20;

Once the Shannon Upgrade launches it will become permissionless to build a Gateway on our infrastructure, including the ability to deploy a Gateway directly for a specific application if that is how you prefer to access the protocol.

For more on Gateways, see [here](broken-reference).

### Our Vision is:

> #### _A future where the world’s most important digital infrastructure is owned and governed by its users_

This is our project roadmap driving us in the future to continue our mission:&#x20;
